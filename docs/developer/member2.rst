~~~~~~~~
This part explains how Players, Coaches and Referees tables are structured and what operations can run on them.

1.1 Players Table
-----------------
* Attributes of the Players Table.
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Name    | Type   | Primary Key | Foreign Key | Auto Increment |
+=========+========+=============+=============+================+
| id      | SERIAL | 1           | 0           | 1              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| name    | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| surname | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| age     | INT    | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| nation  | INT    | 0           | 1           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| team    | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| field   | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| goal    | INT    | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+

* *name* holds the name of the player.
* *surname* holds the surname of the player.
* *age* holds the age of the player.
* *nation* holds the id of the players nation referenced from the country table.
* *team* holds the team that player plays.
* field* holds the players field in tthe pool.
* *goal* holds number of goals that player has scored.

SQL Statement that initializes the Players Table:
   .. code-block:: python

      DROP TABLE IF EXISTS PLAYERS;
      CREATE TABLE PLAYERS(
      ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      NAME TEXT,
      SURNAME TEXT,
      AGE INT,
      NATION INT,
      TEAM TEXT,
      FIELD TEXT,
      GOAL INT);

      ALTER TABLE PLAYERS ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PLAYERS_COUNTRIES FOREIGN KEY (NATION) REFERENCES COUNTRIES (ID) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;

Since *Players(Nation)* is referenced from *Countries(id)* and it is *ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE*, whenever a country is deleted, it will be *NULL*

1.2 Coaches Table
-----------------
* Attributes of the Coaches Table.
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Name    | Type   | Primary Key | Foreign Key | Auto Increment |
+=========+========+=============+=============+================+
| id      | SERIAL | 1           | 0           | 1              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| name    | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| surname | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| nation  | INT    | 0           | 1           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| team    | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+

* *name* holds the name of the coach.
* *surname* holds the surname of the coach.
* *nation* holds the id of the coachs nation referenced from the country table.
* *team* holds the team that coach manages.


SQL Statement that initializes the Coaches Table:
   .. code-block:: python

      DROP TABLE IF EXISTS COACHES;
      CREATE TABLE COACHES(
      ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      NAME TEXT,
      SURNAME TEXT,
      NATION INT,
      TEAM TEXT);

      ALTER TABLE COACHES ADD CONSTRAINT FK_COACHES_COUNTRIES FOREIGN KEY (NATION) REFERENCES COUNTRIES (ID) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;

Since *Coaches(Nation)* is referenced from *Countries(Id)* and it is *ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE*, whenever a country is deleted, it will be *NULL*

1.3 Referees Table
------------------

+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| name    | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| surname | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| league  | INT    | 0           | 1           | 0              |
+---------+--------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| city    | TEXT   | 0           | 0           | 0              |

* *name* holds the name of the referee.
* *surname* holds the surname of the referee.
* *league* describes the level of the referees as int referenced from the league table.
* *city* holds the city that referee is in.


SQL Statement that initializes the Referees Table:
   .. code-block:: python

      DROP TABLE IF EXISTS REFEREES;
      CREATE TABLE REFEREES(
      ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      NAME TEXT,
      SURNAME TEXT,
      LEAGUE INT,
      CITY TEXT);

      ALTER TABLE REFEREES ADD CONSTRAINT FK_REFEREES_LEAGUES FOREIGN KEY (LEAGUE) REFERENCES LEAGUES   (ID) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;

Since *Referees(League)* is referenced from *Leagues(Id)* and it is *ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE*, whenever a league is deleted, it will be *NULL*

2 TABLE OPERATIONS (Add/Delete/Update/Search)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.1 Players Table Operations
----------------------------

   .. code-block:: python

       @app.route('/players')
       def players():
          now = datetime.datetime.now()
          connection = psycopg2.connect(app.config['dsn'])
          cursor = connection.cursor()
          query = """select players.id, players.name, players.surname, players.age, countries.name, players.team, players.field, players.goal from PLAYERS left join countries on players.nation = countries.id;"""
          cursor.execute(query)
          playerListAsTuple = cursor.fetchall()
          playerListAsList = []
          for player in playerListAsTuple:
              playerListAsList.append(list(player))
          cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES ORDER BY NAME;")
          countryListAsTuple = cursor.fetchall()
          connection.close()

          return render_template('players.html', playerList=playerListAsList, current_time=now.ctime(), countryList=countryListAsList)

Above code is the definiton of the players table. First, all columns of players table is selected and added to 'playersListAsTuple'. Since 'Nation' is foreign key referenced to Countries table, it is also selected and added to 'countryListAsTuple'. Then created tuples are passed to 'players.html' file and all players are listed.
