Code and Database Definitions
*****************************

1.1 Database Definitions
------------------------
   .. code-block:: python

      CREATE TABLE TEAMS(ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, FOUNDATION_YEAR INT NOT NULL, COLOURS VARCHAR(50), LEAGUE INT NOT NULL, COUNTRY INT NOT NULL);
      CREATE TABLE MATCHES(ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, HOME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, AWAY VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, REFEREE VARCHAR(50), LEAGUE INT NOT NULL);
      CREATE TABLE COMPETITION(ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, TYPE VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);

**Here ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY definition is done for all tables. This does the increasing one-by-one order for the tuples.**
**League and Country variables are defined as integer. Becaues they are referenced from the Leagues and Countries Tables.**
**And ID of the Lagues and Countries table is referenced, so they are defined as integer.**
