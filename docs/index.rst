**Water Polo**

Our project is providing a database for Water Polo sport.

Website link :http://itucsdb1505.mybluemix.net/

In this project we tried to make traceable World Wide Water Polo matches, tournements, clubs, teams, players and other relevant information.

Project is developed using Eclipse Luna IDE on Ubuntu 14.04.

Python3 programming language and Flask Framework are used for database implementation.

Since this is a student project, it has seperated explanations for sub parts of web site.
